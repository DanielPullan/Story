# About Story

Story is a theme for PicoCMS. I use it for my personal website (<https://danielpullan.co.uk>).

## How Story happened

In the beginning there was light. Then a whole bunch of stuff happened and an IT Technician from the UK needed a theme for his PicoCMS website. I started off using [Magazine](https://github.com/BesrourMS/magazine) but I spent a long time editing the absolute ends of it. Eventually there was nothing left of the original and rather than my theme being a Magazine fork, it just ended up being an entirely new theme. This is where Story came from.

## Can I use Story for my PicoCMS website?

Absolutely! Download the latest release, put it your PicoCMS's /themes folder and edit your config file to set the theme to Story.

I strongly recommend picking some colours that you think reflect you and editing the _style.css file. Currently the top looks like this:

``` :root {
    --text: #eeeeee;
    --link: #DC3D24;
    --title: #DC3D24;
    --background: #1a1a1a;
    --hover: #eeeeee;
    --code: #eeeeee;
}
``` 

Just find the hexcodes of the colours you think reflect you and it will change all over your website. This saves having to change a million colours, there's only 6.

## Can I use Story for my <insert not Pico CMS here> website?

Absolutely, let me know!

## Insert X, Y, Z Feature!

Letters ruin maths and absolutely not. Magazine has lots of features that I stripped out of Story, you might find it more to your liking, or just fork Magazine and add it yourself.
